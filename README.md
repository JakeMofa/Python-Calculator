# Python-Calculator


## 
This is one of my first things which i built, which was a python calculator and uploaded a while back, decided to showcase it having a better introduction and a better graphical userinterface.

##About
This is a Calculator built with python and using the tkinter module, it's rather basic and simple. It composes multiple algorithm structures for each display action and button of the calculator. 

# How it works?
The calculator works basically and easy like any other calculator you would have online or physically, with commands, inputs , such as dividie, multiplication, additon and subtract, fully functional, try to give it a go.
## Improvements
im always here and ready for improvements
